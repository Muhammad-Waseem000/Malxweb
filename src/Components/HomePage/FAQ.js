      Even in 2021, viruses are still a cybersecurity threat. A virus infection is harmful software triggered by performing common tasks such as opening an email attachment, launching an infected program, or viewing an ad on a malicious site. Viruses self-replicate by modifying or completely replacing files.

Viruses are a type of malware. Threat actors use malware often in an attempt to gain money illicitly. Although it likely won't damage the physical hardware of your device or network equipment, different types of malware can be used to steal, encrypt, or delete your data, alter or hijack core computer functions, and spy on your activity.

The best way to protect against a virus infection and malware is to use a legitimate antivirus and anti-malware solution such as Malwarebytes Premium, which not only cleans up viruses but other threats too. It’s powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning and uses multiple types of security technology to keep your device safe.

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
